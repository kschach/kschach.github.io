        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Building on the earlier work of Richard Titmuss, Mimi Abramovitz asserts that “everyone is on welfare” <span class="citation" data-cites="abramovitz1983">(1983:440)</span>, whether through the “social welfare” of direct monetary benefits and in-kind services, the “fiscal welfare” of foregone tax revenue, or the “corporate welfare” of government subsidies for private enterprise. More critically, given that government transfers directed at poverty relief are underfunded in comparison to those targetted towards middle and upper-class individuals and businesses, and that receipt of poor relief is stigmatized in the Western welfare state, Abramovitz argues that the present welfare regime serves to intensify rather than alleviate the vulnerability of the poor. While Abramovitz’s analysis is salient in highlighting the injustice of a situation in which people living in poverty are stigmatized for relying upon government benefits and services for their sustenance while those with resources can access a greater share of government funding without such reprecussions, it elides a further layer of injustice characteristic of contemporary welfare regimes. Not only are poor people channelled towards stigmatized programs of last resort and “less eligiblity” that provide inadequate benefit levels, in many cases they are unable to navigate the complex bureaucratic systems through which these benefits are administered in order to access the benefits to which they are entitled. A caveat might thus be added to Abramovitz’s claim: “everyone is on welfare” … except those without the capacity to claim it.</p>
<p>In the Manitoba context, individuals and families with low incomes may be eligible to receive cash assistance from a variety of monetary benefit programs administered by several federal and provincial government departments. By filing a personal income tax return with Canada Revenue Agency, low-income Manitobans may access supplemental income from provincial refundable tax credits that vary according to their income, age, number and ages of dependent children, amount spent on rent, property tax, and post-secondary tuition, and whether they provide care to an individual with a disability. Individuals with taxable income may also benefit from the fiscal welfare of non-refundable tax credits for low-income workers, post-secondary students, and people with disabilities, among other target groups. Finally, filing an annual income tax return is a prerequisite for accessing the GST/HST credit and Canada Child Benefit, for qualifying for government grants to support post-secondary education savings, and for proving eligibility for social welfare programs including prescription drug coverage and subsidized housing.</p>
<p>Outside of the income tax system, individuals may receive a primary form of income assistance from the Province of Manitoba’s Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) program, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada’s Resettlement Assistance Program, Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)’s Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement, or from one of many First Nations income assistance programs, depending on their age, number of years residing in Canada, immigration class, community of origin, and Indian Act status. Manitoba residents may also be eligible for provincial programs intended to supplement the income of individuals aged 55 and older, individuals with children under the age of 18 in their care and expectant mothers. While there is some overlap, these programs for the most part have distinct aims, eligibility criteria, and application processes. In addition, there are often complex interactions between programs, as receipt of one benefit may be a requirement in order for an individual to access a related benefit, or conversely, may render an individual ineligible for a program with conflicting criteria.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these divergences in goals and logistics, each of the above programs share a fundamental commonality: the capacity of government benefit programs to achieve their aims is limited to the extent to which target populations are able to access benefits for which they are eligible. While data on benefit take-up rates are sparse, literature suggests that significant segments of the Canadian population are not receiving benefits for which they are eligible <span class="citation" data-cites="shillington2011">(Shillington 2011)</span>. As these benefit programs have been ostensibly designed to alleviate the effects of poverty and to ensure a basic level of economic, social, and physical wellbeing among the most vulnerable segments of the population, there has been a growing recognition by governments and non-profit organizations alike of the need to support access to benefits by portions of the population that are entitled to, but not in receipt of these benefits. Emblematic of this trend are the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP), through which community agencies recruit volunteers to prepare free personal income tax returns for low-income Canadian residents, with technical support provided by Canada Revenue Agency, the similarly-structured Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program co-ordinated by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States, and the holistic financial empowerment programs implemented by fifteen municipal governments in the United States and promoted by the Corporation for Economic Development (CFED) and Prosper Canada. More problematically, the private sector has also entered the foray, recognizing the opportunity to profit from brokering access to welfare state benefits through charging an up-front service fee for income tax provision and paperwork completion or procuring a percentage of the realized benefits.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to assess the impacts that non-profit and government financial empowerment programs have in increasing benefit take-up among the low-income population as a whole, on a micro level it is clear that there is a significant demand for access to benefits supports, and that the provision of these supports has facilitated access to welfare state cash benefits by people living on low incomes. In Manitoba alone, the mass CVITP clinics run by Community Financial Counselling Services recruited 100 volunteers to file 9,000 tax returns during the 2016 income tax filing season, which brought upwards of <span class="math inline">$21,000,000 into the hands of low-income Manitobans in the form of income tax refunds and benefits administered through the income tax system. During the same period, the smaller, staff-driven Access to Benefits program run by SEED Winnipeg and community partners supported low-income families to gain access to __$</span>NUMBER__ in direct government benefits as well as providing a variety of complementary financial empowerment supports, including obtaining identification, opening no-free basic bank accounts, and gaining access to government and community asset-building opportunities. Furthermore, government and philanthropic interest in investing in the capacity of the non-profit sector to offer financial empowerment programming, including support to access income benefits, is evident in new funding commitments made by the Government of Canada and Province of Ontario, and the approval by the Province of Manitoba to re-dedicate funding from the Manitoba Saves initiative towards individualized access to benefits supports.</p>
<p>While the need for interventions to assist low income individuals to access government benefits finds some support in the literature, and the popularity of this approach is apparent in the existence of non-profit programs and government and philanthropic funding, the value of such an approach in contributing to social and economic justice is decidedly less clear. On one hand, the success of such programs in empowering financially vulnerable community members to access government benefits and thereby increase their wellbeing can be seen as a positive step towards economic redistribution that ensures that the state fulfills its commitment to provide income benefits. Furthermore, the relationships developed between government policymakers and non-profit agencies in funding and administering these programs may be useful in providing service providers with opportunities to represent service users by advocating for changes to the systems through which benefits are delivered. On the other hand, may be an indicator of injustice, signifying the inaccessibility of government benefits, the impenetrability of the bureaucracies through which benefits are delivered, and a failure by the state to address these issues to ensure that benefits are accessible. In this regard, the presence of nonprofit access to benefits programs may be seen as a consequence of welfare state retrenchment whereby the voluntary sector assumes responsibility that the state has offloaded, either through nonprofit-state partnerships or through efforts by nonprofits to raise the resources needed to fill gaps created by the withdrawal of state services.</p>
<p>This project will analyze the recent investment in programs that support financially vulnerable community members to access monetary and non-monetary welfare state benefits for which they are eligible and entitled, and yet unable to access without third-party support. By focussing on the work undertaken by community organizations in Winnipeg that support low-income community members to access welfare state benefits, including SEED Winnipeg, this project will examine whether and how service providers in this field attempt to bridge the gap between individual casework that supports service users to improve their wellbeing and working with and for service users to transform unjust structures and cultures that affect their lives. By extrapolation, I will assess the transformative potential of non-profit access to benefits services: Can social service providers facilitate access to welfare state benefits while concurrently contributing towards the realization of a more accessible and equitable system of redistribution? What role, if any, are non-profit agencies equipped to play in such a movement for social and economic justice?</p>
