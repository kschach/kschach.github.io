Research Focus / Questions
--------------------------

-   NGOs as a vehicle/site for practicing prefigurative politics and
    contributing to social change
-   How can NGOs contribute to the development of more just social
    relations / structural transformation?
-   Does the devolution of social welfare service provision to an NGO
    “shadow state” provide new opportunities for social welfare
    organizations to contribute to social change and building new social
    relations?

Issues
------

-   Differences between NGO staff providing social welfare supports and
    recipients
    -   Experiences of oppression / injustice
    -   Different class interests
    -   Power dynamics affecting the process of service delivery
-   Relationships with service recipients:
    -   Characterized by othering, paternalism
    -   Various language used:
        -   participants
        -   clients
        -   consumers
        -   recipients
        -   customers
        -   patients
        -   partners
        -   users
-   To whom are NGOs held accountable?
    -   Traditionally to boards and funders.
    -   How can NGOs be more directly accountable to the participants /
        clients / constituents they serve?
-   How can NGOs practice prefigurative politics?
    -   Workplace democracy
    -   Building new relationships with participants
    -   Providing settings in which participants can build communities,
        connect with one another
-   Can an organizational focus on “soft” outcomes provide an
    opportunity for prefiguring alternatives?

Operationalizing the Idea
-------------------------

-   Literature review / synthesis connecting the relevant literature
    bases
    -   Acknowledging my own positionality and experience as an NGO
        worker within the research
-   Case study comparison between Aboriginal Youth Opportunities (AYO)
    and SEED?
    -   Difficulty gaining access to the field
        -   How to make the research relevant to the
            organizations/people involved
    -   Concerned about the work inherent in primary qualitative
        research

Ideas from our July 14th meeting
--------------------------------

-   Bureaucracies working effectively from perspective of
    users (i.e. Sweden)
    -   Recognizing that institutionalization is not monolithic
    -   Can be less disciplinary and more enabling to users
    -   How can institutions work for the 99%?
-   Recognizing that prefigurative politics / politics of decolonization
    can be accomodated and co-opted.
    -   How can it be re-worked?
-   Critical realist approach
    -   “What does SEED do as an institution that allows it to treat
        participants as dignified others?”
    -   Ethnography: how do people act differently here
-   People focus on how social justice institutions get co-opted but
    fail to recognize the radical energy required to found these
    institutions
    -   Reminds me of: “Can organizations learn to sustain the energy
        and desire that called them into being?” – Margaret Wheatley and
        Myron Kellner-Rogers [cited in @barringtonbush2013 9]
