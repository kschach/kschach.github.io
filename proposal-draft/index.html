        <p>The important role played by non-profit organizations in delivering social services to the population has been highlighted by <span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">Salamon (1995)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="wolch1989">Wolch (1989)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="hall1998">Hall and Reed (1998)</span>, who have quantified the scale of the non-profit social service sector in terms of number of organizations and employees, and amount of government funds received.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholars have advanced a variety of theories to explain the enormous growth in the non-profit sector’s role in delivering social services and to explicate the benefits and drawbacks of this model of collective service provision. Traditionally, the presence of the voluntary sector in social service provision has been considered to be the result of a combined “market failure,” characterized by an inability for consumers to privately procure needed services, and a “government failure” of the state to collectively provide these services through public welfare state institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">(Salamon 1995)</span>. According to these theories, the voluntary sector steps in to provide social services when the state and market fail to do so. <span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">Salamon (1995)</span> argues against these reductive explanations and counterposes that much of the growth of voluntary sector social service provision is the result of government investment in the sector through partnerships between state funding agencies and non-profit organizations who utilize public funds to deliver services. Salamon situates these partnerships within a larger trend of “third-party government”, by which the role of government as a fundraiser and funder has become separated from its role as a direct service provider <span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">(Salamon 1995 PAGE)</span>. In support of this claim, Salamon finds that the massive growth in the reach and size of the U.S. federal government in the period of welfare state expansion between the 1950s and 1980s was enacted through partnerships between the federal government, lower levels of government, for-profit industry, and the non-profit sector. In this period, government growth occurred primarily in its capacity to procure and distribute funds, without a concomitant increase in the scale of direct government program delivery. Instead, these responsibilities became increasingly assumed by private and non-profit organizations, who utilized public funds to deliver services through private institutional forms.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="milward1994">Milward (1994)</span> conceives that this split between the government’s active role in procuring and distributing funds and its reduced role in direct service provision reflects a tendency towards the state becoming a “hollow state.” <span class="citation" data-cites="wolch1989">Wolch (1989:201)</span>, meanwhile argues that the expanded role played by the voluntary sector in delivering publicly funded social services has led to the formation of “a shadow state … a para-state apparatus with collective service responsibilities previously shouldered by the public sector, administered outside democratic politics, but yet controlled in both formal and informal ways by the state.”</p>
<p>Political support for the voluntary sector to assume an increased role in delivering social services has come from both the right and the left. Conservative arguments call for “mediating institutions” such as voluntary organizations to play a more active role in social service in order to guard against and reduce undue government interference into the private lives of the citizenry.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Progressive arguments position voluntary sector social service provision as an addition to rather than a replacement for public social welfare services and as a means for people to assume more autonomy over the welfare of their communities.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While the latter view paints a rosy picture in which voluntary sector social services increase the stock of social welfare and further the realization of social justice in a given community, the literature identifies several issues which collectively suggest that devolution from the state to the community may have the opposite effect by reducing access to basic entitlements and necessary social services by vulnerable segments of the population.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">Salamon (1995)</span> identifies four forms of “voluntary failure” that may render the voluntary sector ill-equipped to take on responsibility for welfare provision in the absence of state support. For one, as organizations reliant upon voluntary contributions, non-profit social service agencies would face difficulties in securing the funds required to deliver vital social services. A potentially significant source of non-state funding is from tax-deductible donations made by wealthy individuals, foundations, and corporations. However, relying upon these sources is problematic given that these donors often prefer to donate to arts and cultural organizations and educational institutions than to social services organizations that work in marginalized communities. Furthermore, reliance upon wealthy donors may usher in a form of “philanthropic paternalism” <span class="citation" data-cites="salamon1995">(Salamon 1995 PAGE)</span> as the donors who foot large portions of the bill for social service programming may make their contributions conditional in order to shape the content of services and programs as well as criteria defining target groups who are eligible to access these services.</p>
<p>Conversely, foregoing large donations and relying upon communities of service users to fund the costs of the services they access through small donations or user fees presents its own issues. While this approach may be beneficial in furthering local control over the provision of social welfare services in a community, in practice service levels would likely be inadequate in economically marginalized communities. The same shortage of income and assets that makes social services necessary in the first place would make it unlikely that community members requiring these services would have the resources to pay for their provision. Finally, periods of economic downturn would be especially problematic for social service agencies reliant upon private contributions. At such times, when an increased proportion of the population requires access to social welfare supports, agencies’ ability to procure funding from user fees and individual donations would be further reduced.</p>
