Research Question
=================

-   Is the proliferation of access to benefits programming a move
    towards social justice, reflecting a multi-sector push to increasing
    access among to the welfare state by low-income populations?
-   Conversely, is this model an indicator of a more fundamental
    injustice in that government-community collaborations on access to
    benefits services effectively broker access to welfare state
    benefits and force people living in poverty to rely upon a necessary
    but insufficient voluntary sector (Salamon) in order to successfully
    receive statutory entitlements.

Theory
======

-   Social justice:
-   @fraser1997:
    -   Is the current model of access to benefits a strategy of
        affirmation or one of transformation? Can government and
        philanthropically funded nonprofit access to benefits services
        pursue a strategy of transformation?
-   Materialist ethics [@noonan2012]
    -   TBD.
-   Uniting social service with social justice
-   Draw upon @withorn1984 and Kivel
    [@incitewomenofcoloragainstviolence2007].
-   Ambivalent effect of welfare state:
    -   Social citizenship [@marshall1950] and Welfare rights (Sparer)
    -   Social welfare and social control [@piven1993].
    -   Marxist critiques [@gough1979; @oconnor2001-1; @offe1984]
-   Ambivalent effect of devolution of social service work from
    government institutions to the voluntary sector.
    -   The shadow state [@wolch1989]
    -   Third party government [@salamon1995]
    -   Non-profits for hire [@smith1993]
    -   More community autonomy, or lesser capacity?

Questions That Arise
====================

-   Can efforts to increase access to welfare state entitlements
    concurrently increase well-being in the present through the
    provision of necessary but inadequate benefits as well as pressure
    for a more just distribution of opportunities and resources?
-   Are non-profit organizations appropriately positioned to work
    towards each of these goals through access to benefits services, or
    are they limited to providing social services due to a lack of
    capacity to effect deeper social change?\
-   What about changing cultures and prefiguring alternative forms of
    social welfare and service provision?

Historical and Contemporary Context
===================================

History of Poor Relief
----------------------

-   Provision by the voluntary and religious organizations, mutual aid
    societies.
    -   Voluntary sector failure [@salamon1995].
    -   Mutual aid societies [@beito2003].
-   The poor house, Elizabethan poor laws [@piven1993].
-   Growth of the welfare state
    -   Look into when social assistance was enacted in Canada.
        -   Canada Assistance Plan?
    -   New Deal and Great Society welfare state expansions.
-   Retrenchment
    -   Cutbacks to programs
    -   Bureaucratic disentitlement [@lipsky1984]
    -   Offloading of social services through privatization and
        partnerships with voluntary sector.
-   Era of financialization, complexity of benefits
    -   Switch to account-based, application-based system of benefits,
        without governmental provision of necessary supports. (Find
        source)
    -   Community organizations and municipal governments have assumed
        responsibility for providing these supports. (Financial
        empowerment)
    -   Low take-up of many benefits, and high degree of financial
        literacy required in order to access these benefits
        [@shillington2011].

Non-profit Organizations in The Welfare State
---------------------------------------------

Non-profit Organizations and Social Movements
---------------------------------------------

Welfare Rights Movement
-----------------------

-   Sparer - Welfare Rights
-   Kornbluh

Basic Income Guarantee
----------------------

-   In addition to the contemporary access to benefits push, will also
    tie in to an adjacent yet surpisingly disconnected contemporary
    economic justice movement: the call for a basic income guarantee.
    -   While the former literature focuses on pragmatic issues of
        access to the present array of welfare state benefits without
        explicitly framing access within a broader conception of justice
        and equity.
    -   Conversely, the prevailing literature formulates and assesses
        the implications of more equitable systems for social welfare
        provision, and calls for their implementation, they largely
        neglect to address the pragmatic supports that are needed to
        broker access to benefit-delivery systems they propose.
        Furthermore, while calling for the implementation of a more
        equitable social welfare benefits in the future, contemporary
        literature in this area often does not address the question of
        how to support people to access income-boosting benefits in the
        here-and-now without undermining the longer movement towards
        realizing a more equitable benefits system.

Methodology
===========

-   Comparative case study between contemporary access to benefits
    programming and 1960s welfare rights services and welfare rights
    movement.
-   I will rely upon academic texts which retroactively recount the
    history of this movement, examine its ideology and tactics, and
    analyze its successes and failures
    [@piven1993; @piven1979; @kornbluh2007], as well as upon texts
    written by academics who participated in the movement and directly
    explicated its theory and strategy \[@piven2011; Sparer\].
    -   What are the lessons from the successes and failures of this
        movement?
    -   How do their tactics and framing compare to the present trend?
    -   How did the welfare rights movement connect social service work
        with a broader vision of social justice?
-   In examining contemporary access to benefits programming, I will
    draw upon the knowledge and access to the field which I have gained
    through my present employment as a Program Coordinator at SEED
    Winnipeg. In this position, I played a prominent role in the design
    and development of the Access to Benefits program, and have
    continued to be involved in delivering and administering the
    program. My role includes program development, research, reporting
    and evaluation, as well as working with community members to
    navigate through the barriers they face in order to access the
    income streams, financial services, and asset building opportunities
    to which they are entitled.
-   In addition, I will conduct informal expert interviews with
    colleagues who are more heavily involved in day-to-day program
    delivery in order to better understand how they conceive of the
    connections between social service work and the realization of a
    broader vision of social justice.
