        <p>Given that access to benefits programs operate by brokering access to the current complement of social welfare benefits, my analysis of the potential for these programs to enhance social and economic justice necessitates a theory of the welfare state. Assuming an ideal situation in which access programs were tremendously successful in connecting community members to all welfare state entitlements, would sufficient redistribution occur to ensure that all residents receive the income and services needed to sustain the conditions of life? Or conversely, does socioeconomic justice require more than the redistribution that can be accomplished through 100% take-up of the current complement of welfare state benefits?</p>
<p>The literature is mixed with respect to the role that the welfare state should play as a lever for socioeconomic justice and the extent to which liberal welfare states have fulfilled this role in practice.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On one pole, T.H. Marshall offers a strong normative statement in favor of state intervention in support of socioeconomic justice. Writing in 1949, Marshall argues that social welfare provision is the next logical step in a historical progression through which liberal states have expanded the rights of their citizenry and worked towards equality among citizens. Building upon civil rights and political rights, which have been enacted to varying degrees depending on one’s geographical and social location, social citizenship include “the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security [and] the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilised being according to the standards prevailing in the society” <span class="citation" data-cites="marshall1950">(Marshall 1950:11)</span>. There is a clear affinity between Marshall’s ideal of social citizenship and the vision for socioeconomic justice I derive from Fraser and Noonan. Accordingly, programs working within a socially democratic welfare regime may contribute to the realization of socioeconomic justice through supporting access to universal entitlements by groups that face particular barriers.</p>
<p>Conversely, critical analyses of the social welfare benefits and services offered by liberal welfare states suggest that they have fallen short of Marshall’s ideal. Rather than aspiring to provide all citizens with the resources needed to fully participate in the life of the society, the welfare states of Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, among others, instead remain predicated upon the British Poor Laws, which offer aid as a last resort and ensure that it is less desirable than the prevailing wages available in the market (the principle of “less eligibility”). Given that movements of the working poor have argued that minimum wage employment does not provide the living wage required to sustain life, it is apparent that welfare benefits specifically designed to offer less than the prevailing market wage will be insufficient, even if access programs successfully connect vulnerable groups to these benefits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, critics have argued that the expansion of the welfare state benefits throughout history has not been part of a benevolent progression towards social citizenship, but rather a cycle of expansion and contraction intended to regulate the supply of labour. Piven and Cloward’s analysis of the American welfare state finds that the availability of what they term “poor relief” is increased at times of mass social upheaval, and then subsequently reduced once economic stability was restored <span class="citation" data-cites="piven1993">(1993)</span>. Piven and Cloward argue that the mass expansion of the American welfare state through the 1930s New Deal and the 1960s Great Society programs was motivated less by a benevolent concern for the welfare of a disadvantaged populace and more by a calculated assessment of the level of state intervention needed to maintain social order and ensure profitable conditions for capital. Following this logic, if a liberal welfare state is designed to mitigate the self-defeating harmful effects of capitalism rather than to provide for the enjoyment of social citizenship by the populace, aid will be extended and withdrawn according to factors extrinsic to the level of human need. Thus even if access to income benefits is secured and human needs are satisfied, changes to the welfare state – including reduced generosity of benefits and punitive treatment of benefit recipients – may be introduced in order to discipline benefit recipients to re-enter the labor market.</p>
<p>The critical literature also identifies several inequalities that affect the forms of benefits for which specific demographics qualify, the relative generosity of these benefits, and the social relations that shape how benefit recipients are treated by state agencies as well as by fellow citizens. A fundamental inequality persists along the axis of class, dividing individuals with earned employment or investment income from individuals with allegedly “unearned” income. While the former group benefits primarily from fiscal welfare policies implemented through the personal income tax system, the latter rely on social welfare benefits delivered outside the tax system <span class="citation" data-cites="abramovitz1983 titmuss1965">(Abramovitz 1983; Titmuss 1965)</span>. A similar divide separates individuals who have worked in the paid labour market for a sufficient period of time from those who do not meet this criteria. The first group are eligible to receive social insurance benefits that have been designed to partially replace the income lost as a result of retirement, disability, parenthood, and involuntary job loss, and among other life events, and that index benefit amounts to employee contributions. The latter group does not qualify for these benefits and is instead forced to rely upon social assistance programs <span class="citation" data-cites="olsen2002">(Olsen 2002)</span>.</p>
<p>The differences between fiscal welfare and social insurance programs, on the one hand, and social assistance programs, on the other, are significant. Benefit levels are higher in contribution-based programs than they are in programs reliant upon means tests. The aggregate expenditures on fiscal welfare measures far outstrip social welfare spending <span class="citation" data-cites="abramovitz1983">(Abramovitz 1983)</span>. Most saliently, accessing social assistance requires recipients to subject themselves to means tests, the surveillance of benefit administrators and investigators, and a litany of rules and regulations that define what they must do in order to remain eligible for benefits and which social and economic behaviours are disallowed. Receipt of social assistance is moreover stigmatized in the dominant social discourse, and social assistance recipients are portrayed as dependent upon unearned handouts from the state <span class="citation" data-cites="fraser1994 fraser1992">(Fraser and Gordon 1992, 1994)</span>. Conversely, beneficiaries of fiscal welfare measures and social insurance programs are considered in a more favorable light: as accessing the just rewards they deserve as a result of their economic contributions as income earners and taxpayers.</p>
<p>Class is not the only axis of inequality that shapes and is shaped by the welfare state; class intersects with gender, ‘race,’ ethnicity, citizenship and residency status, indigeneity, and other factors to form a stratified welfare system in which the benefits for which an individual qualifies are to a large extent determined by their social location. The literature identifies a number of examples of how welfare state rules and regulations systemically disadvantage particular groups of people. Social insurance programs do not count the unpaid domestic labour performed primarily by women as employment, and thereby fail to recognize this labour when assessing eligibility for contribution-based benefits. Social assistance programs have also served to regulate and restrict the social behaviour of women through restricting the provision of aid to widows and mothers, denying aid to women who live with a “man in the house”, or assuming the existence of romantic and economic relationships between unrelated men and women living in the same household. The result in all of these cases is that the welfare state draws upon and reinforces the injustice faced by women living in poverty by assuming the male breadwinner as the primary economic actor and relegating women to a secondary position of dependency.</p>
<p>Inequality also pervades along lines of ‘race’, citizenship and residency status, and indigeneity. Racialized communities have been systematically excluded from receipt of social assistance benefits in order to reinforce their dependence on low-wage jobs that exploit their labour. Indigenous peoples have had their social assistance benefits channeled through parallel systems that may be underfunded, or through colonial systems that fail to recognize their particular experiences. Finally, first generation immigrants, including refugees and temporary workers, have been denied access to welfare state benefits due to their residency status as temporary workers or undocumented immigrants, or in spite of attaining permanent residence status or citizenship, as a result of having not lived in the country for a sufficient length of time.</p>
<p>The above review suggests that the liberal welfare state falls well short of Marshall’s ideal of social citizenship. Minimum benefit levels offered through social assistance programs are insufficient to sustain the necessities of life by virtue of the design requirement that social assistance should be “less eligible” than minimum wage labour. Community members receiving social assistance benefits are subjected to disempowering treatment by benefit administrators and by public discourse that stigmatizes receipt of welfare as pathological dependence. Finally, inequalities based on class, gender, and ‘race’ endure, affecting both the forms of benefits for which an individual qualifies and the generosity of these benefits.</p>
<p>My analysis of the potential for access to benefits programs to contribute to socioeconomic justice must therefore consider the specific benefits being accessed through these programs, the demographic groups gaining access to these benefits, and the extent to which specific benefits provide for the necessities of life while respecting the dignity and autonomy of recipients. Furthermore, this review calls critical attention to the intervention strategies employed by access programs. How do the injustices inherent in liberal welfare state constrain programs focused primarily on securing access to welfare state benefits? Are there unintended harms that could result from the inclusion of vulnerable community members as benefit recipients? Finally, if access to benefits programs broaden their approach beyond direct service delivery, what strategies could be effective in pushing the state to assume greater responsibility for social citizenship?</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Although the literature cited in this section predominantly draws from a British ideal of social citizenship and American critiques of their exceptionally residual welfare state, the theories I draw upon are also valuable in the Canadian context. While Canada’s universal social welfare services (including public health care) and categorical entitlements may distinguish Canada as a “social liberal” welfare state (Olsen), it shares many commonalities with the liberal welfare states that feature more prominently in the literature. Most importantly for the purposes of this project, Canadian social assistance programs also stem from the British Poor Laws, and social assistance remains a benefit of last resort rather than a universal or categorical citizens’ entitlement.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
