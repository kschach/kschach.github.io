## Rugby for Americans

### First, a warning

This presentation is only an intro. Rugby is too nuanced to cover in its entirety in this amount of time.

#HSLIDE

## The basics

#VSLIDE

Pitch is 100m long and 70m wide.

At each end is a "try zone" and an H-shaped goal.

#VSLIDE

#VSLIDE

Each side has 15 players (in 15s) or 7 players (in 7s).

There is only one referee on the pitch, and two touch judges (one per sideline).

#VSLIDE

BTW: the referee speaks holy truth sent directly from heaven and must never be questioned.

#VSLIDE

In 15s, matches have two halves of 40 minutes each, with a 10-minute break between.

In 7s, matches have two halves of 7 minutes each, with a 2-minute break between.

#VSLIDE

Play does not stop just because somebody is tackled, or just because a pass is incomplete.

#VSLIDE

A limited number of player substitutions are allowed, but players who leave the pitch are finished and cannot go back in. (There are a few exceptions for blood and for the front row.)

#VSLIDE

Mouthguards are optional, and scrum caps are useful for keeping forwards' ears intact. Otherwise, there's no bulky protective equipment like in American football.

## Playing the game

#VSLIDE

Play starts with a drop-kick at the center line.

![Image-Absolute](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Italian_kickoff.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Any player can run with the ball; pass the ball backwards to a teammate; hand the ball off to a teammate; or kick the ball.

Forward passing is never permitted.

#VSLIDE

The defending team can tackle the ball-carrier; hold the ball-carrier; drive the ball-carrier out of bounds ("into touch"); or try to take the ball away.

The defending team cannot interfere with any player who doesn't have the ball.

#VSLIDE

Play continues *uninterrupted* until somebody scores, the ball goes into touch, or the referee whistles an infraction of the laws.

#VSLIDE

If the ball carrier is tackled to the ground, then the tackler must release the ball carrier, and the ball carrier must release the ball.

Any player on his/her feet can then pick up the ball and run with it.

#VSLIDE

Players can also decide to form a ruck over the ball once it's down.

![Image-Absolute](http://sp.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/2600/2682.jpg)

It's an ad-hoc struggle for the ball. Players push against each other so that one of their teammates can get to the ball.

#VSLIDE

If the ball carrier is held up, but doesn't go to the ground, then a maul forms.

![Image-Absolute](http://sp.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/8900/8979.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Players can bind onto the maul and attempt to push it towards their team's try zone.

They can also try to take the ball out of the maul and run with it.

#VSLIDE

If the ball goes out of play, then a "line out" can form to bring it back in.

## Scrums
![Image-Absolute](http://www.brandproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rugby-scrum.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Scrums are the greatest part of rugby, and anybody who argues that point is just plain wrong.

Trust me. I know things.

#VSLIDE

The referee can signal for a scrum to restart play after a minor infraction of the laws, such as a forward pass, or after a ruck or maul gets stuck.

Eight players from each side bind onto each other to form two solid masses.

![Image-Absolute](http://sp.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/500/556.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Once the referee signals, the two packs collide. One of the team's scrumhalves puts the ball into the center, and the two packs compete for control of the ball.

#VSLIDE

Eventually, the ball finds its way to the back of the scrum, where it can be picked up, and open play resumes.

#VSLIDE

Scrums are the game within the game. They are intense and exhausting and painful and smelly and wonderful and amazing and just looking at this one makes my neck hurt.

## Scoring

#VSLIDE

If a player grounds the ball in the try zone, then they score a "try", worth five points.

![Image-Absolute](http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2012/08/18/1226453/279161-israel-dagg-try.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Once a try has been scored, that team gets a chance to kick through the uprights for a "conversion", worth two points. The kick can happen from any distance but it must be in line with the place where the try was scored.

![Image-Absolute](http://sp.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/10600/10626.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Players can also kick the ball through the uprights during regular play or after a penalty for a "goal", worth three points.

#VSLIDE

After one team scores, play is restarted with another kick-off from center.

In 7s, the team that scored kicks; in 15s, the team that did not score kicks.

#HSLIDE

## Positions

![Image-Absolute](http://www.lineoutcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rugby-positions1.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Every position has its own characteristic strengths, but *anybody* on the pitch has the opportunity to pass, run, kick, catch, tackle, be tackled, or score points, as the circumstances demand.

#VSLIDE

It's also important to note that there's a position well-suited to any build or height.

#VSLIDE

### Forwards

#### Positions 1-8

#VSLIDE

The front row of the scrum is composed of a loosehead prop (#1), a hooker (#2), and a tighthead prop (#3).

The props hold the scrum up. They are stout, strong, and when they score it's just fucking majestic.

The hooker uses his/her foot to "hook" the ball during the scrum. They are short, quick, good-looking, smart, and exceptionally modest.

#VSLIDE

The second row of the scrum is composed of two locks (#4 and #5).

Locks are tall, and their strength drives the scrum forward. They often jump for the ball in line outs.

The props, locks, and hooker are known as the "tight five".

#VSLIDE

The flankers (#6 and #7) bind onto either side of the locks. The eight-man or number 8 binds onto the back of the scrum.

The flankers and #8 are known as "loose forwards" and are the first to break off the scrum when the ball comes out.

#VSLIDE

### Backs

#### Positions 9-15

#VSLIDE

The scrumhalf (#9) controls the flow of the game, putting the ball in the scrum and digging it out of the ruck.

Scrumhalves are usually the smallest players on the pitch, but they have the biggest ~~mouths~~ personalities.

#VSLIDE

The flyhalf (#10) is the "general" of the back line, directing plays and distributing the ball.

Flyhalves are usually tall, sharp-eyed, and can receive any kind of terrible pass (but only make beautiful passes).

#VSLIDE

The wings (#11 and #14) are the most agile players on the pitch. They score the most tries.

There's no strict requirement for wings. They just have to be quick and nimble. More often than not, wings will have great hair.

#VSLIDE

The centers (#12 and #13) are the "platform" for back-line plays. They draw in defenders, opening up space for other players to get through.

Centers tend to be in the best shape of the whole team. They also take a lot of physical contact.

#VSLIDE

The fullback (#15) is the last line of defense. Fullbacks make the most kicks, and receive the most kicks.

Fullbacks are the bravest and most foolhardy, since their tackles are done at full speed in the open.

#HSLIDE

## Culture

![Image-Absolute](http://yantrarugbyclub.com/img/gallery/c18d03facd4167f74abe5d4325a1663112.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Rugby is as much a social endeavor as it is a sport, so the gathering after the match is just as important as the activity on the pitch.

At the “third half”, the home team hosts the visitors for food and drink (and drink, and drink, and drink), and everybody is friends once more.

#VSLIDE

There are many traditions for the third half. Most of those are NSFW, but there'll be drinking games, occasional nudity, and unusual and unsanitary drinking vessels. 

There are also many drinking songs. All of those are NSFW, and some could cost me my career.

## What rugby has taught me

![Image-Absolute](jim-magnitude-plate.jpg)

#VSLIDE

Things may not go according to plan. Keep going anyway.

![Image-Absolute](streets-gets-through.jpg)

#VSLIDE

It always helps to have a solid team behind you...

![Image-Absolute](jim-spring-fever-scrum.jpg)

#VSLIDE

...even if the outlook is a bit grim...

![Image-Absolute](collin-snowy-scrum.jpg)

#VSLIDE

...and even if you have to step up and take one for the team every so often.

![Image-Absolute](jim-shiner.jpg)

#VSLIDE

A good team is always worth it, though.
